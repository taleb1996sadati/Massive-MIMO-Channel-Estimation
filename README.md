# Massive-MIMO-Channel-Estimation
Channel Estimation in FDD Massive MIMO Using Linear Regression

In this project set of transmit antennas devided to 2 sets, 1 set transmit pilot and the other just transmit data.
to estimate the Channel Impulse Response (CIR), Linear Regression Algorithm is applied.
